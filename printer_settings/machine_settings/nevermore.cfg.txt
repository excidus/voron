# Sensor Settings

# voc index \in [175, 500], threshold where the system stops adjusting the
# calibration because the air is "unusually dirty". (AKA 'gating')
# VOC emissions can significantly vary between different filament materials and
# brands.
# Set this threshold to the 'typical' VOC index observed mid print.
# Setting this *too* low will prevent the system from adjusting to normal
# air quality variations. Advised not to set < 225.
# If you print with multiple materials/brands, see the G-Code command
# `NEVERMORE_VOC_GATING_THRESHOLD_OVERRIDE`.
